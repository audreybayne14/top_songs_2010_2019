**Distribution of BPM by Genre**

This correlation heatmap visualizes the relationships between various song features. Key insights include a strong positive correlation (0.54) between energy (nrgy) and loudness (dB), indicating that louder songs tend to have higher energy levels. Danceability (dnce) also shows a notable positive correlation (0.5) with valence (val), suggesting that more danceable songs tend to have a more positive or cheerful tone. Conversely, acousticness (acous) is negatively correlated with energy (-0.56), indicating that more acoustic songs tend to have lower energy levels. There is also a weak negative correlation between song duration (dur) and valence (-0.26), implying that longer songs are slightly less likely to be perceived as positive. The correlation between year and popularity (pop) is 0.24, suggesting a modest trend where newer songs in this dataset tend to be more popular.
